## Reakt IO

IO Library that provides common interface for doing reactive IO in Java.

You can implement these interfaces with Jetty, Netty, Vert.x, Undertow,
 Conekt, etc.

It is an common IO interface API that is an IO non-blocking and reactive. 

It uses Reakt Callbacks, Promises and Streams. 

QBit 2.0 will use Nektwork which can be backed by Vert.x, Conekt, and
other Nektwork implementations.




Libraries like QBit, Elekt, Lokate can use Nektwork and they will work with other libs.
